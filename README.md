## General information

The information below is identical to the information in the [course outline](https://github.com/jstac/econ-2125-8013/blob/master/PDFs/course_outline.pdf?raw=true) and repeated only for convenience.


### Titles 

-   Mathematics A (2125)

-   Optimization for Economics and Financial Economics (2125)

-   Mathematical Techniques in Economics I (8013)

### Course Description 

Together with ECON2127/ECON8014, this course forms a two-semester
sequence that introduces students to a range of foundational
mathematical concepts and techniques routinely used in economic theory
and quantitative modeling for economics, finance and business. The
concepts and techniques will be derived from basic principles and
illustrated using a variety of applications.

Optimization will be a recurring theme in the course, since much of
economic theory involves optimization, as do a diverse range of
econometric, statistical and financial problems. However, a number of
other foundational topics in mathematical modeling will also be treated.
These include linear algebra, dynamics and probability theory.

### Learning Outcomes 

Upon a successful completion of this course, students should be able to:

-   Understand many of the mathematical methods that are most widely
    used in economics, both from a formal, abstract perspective, and an
    intuitive perspective.

-   Know how to read, understand, and construct simple mathematical
    proofs, and appreciate their role in the derivation of mathematical
    concepts and structures.

-   Apply mathematical methods and techniques that are formulated in
    abstract settings to concrete economic applications.

### List of Topics 

The main topics of the course will be

1.  Linear algebra

2.  Elementary real analysis

3.  Foundations of probability theory

4.  Multivariate calculus and optimization

5.  Introduction to dynamics

6.  Orthogonal projection and its applications

7.  Further applications

Topics may vary slightly at the instructor’s discretion depending on the
rate of progress and level of the students.

### Instructor 

John Stachurski

Office: Room 2006, HW Arndt Building 25a

Email: `john.stachurski@anu.edu.au`

Contact hours: Monday 9:00–11:00 AM


### Lecture Timetable 

Lecture | Time | Location
------------| --------------------| --------------
Lecture A:  | Wednesday 10–11 AM  | CBE BLD LT 2
Lecture B:  | Thursday 9–10 AM    | CBE BLD LT 2

Important: Lecture C as listed in the course timetable is *not currently
active*. No lecture will take place outside the two listed above unless
otherwise advised. (Lectures for graduate students are likely to be held
in the C slot later in the semester. Students will be advised through
both lectures and Wattle if and when this occurs.)


### Tutorials 

Tutorials are on Fridays in Room TR6 of HW Arndt Building 25a

Group | Time
---------| -------------
Group 1  |   12:00–13:00
Group 2  |   13:00–14:00
Group 3  |   14:00–15:00

Further details will be given in the first lecture. The two tutors for
this course are

Name | Email | Room
--------------| ---------------------------| -----------------------------
Qingyin Ma    | `qingyin.ma@anu.edu.au`    | Room 1125 Copland Building
Guanlong Ren  | `guanlong.ren@anu.edu.au`  | Room 2018 HW Arndt Building

### Resources 

As well as the usual Wattle course page, which students should check regularly
for up to date information related to the course, this GitHub page will store
all PDFs and other reading material related to the course.

All of the lecture slides used through the course will be made available to
students as PDF files. The lecture slides will be relatively comprehensive and
self-contained, and serve as the primary source of reading material for
students. Slides corresponding to each lecture will be made available to
students as downloadable files on this page shortly before (best case) or
immediately after the corresponding lecture.

On this page you will also find a PDF file called `course_notes.pdf`. These
notes give additional background and practice exercises for some *but not all*
topics treated in the course.

Finally, recording of lectures will usually be made available but
unrecorded lectures are quite likely to occur and hence the recordings
should not be relied upon.


### Assessment 

Assessment will consist of one mid-term exam and one final exam. The
weighting is

Exam | Weight
----------------| ----
Mid-term exam:  |   40
Final exam:     |   60

ECON2125 and ECON8013 students will be assessed in separate pools with
possible variation in requirements and standards. Final grades may not
be an exact sum of exam scores, due to post-processing by the university
administration. This processing might alter the absolute value of
individual scores but it will not affect the ranking.

### Further Reading 

One recommended source of material related to the course is

-   Simon, C. and L. Blume (1994) *Mathematics for Economists.* Norton

In past years this text has been compulsory but this year it is only
recommended. It will be useful as background reading and a source of
practice questions for many parts of the course.

All topics are standard and plenty of useful free material can be found
on the Internet on a case by case basis. For example,
http://math.stackexchange.com can be very helpful. Other texts that might be
useful to understand the course material—but are *in no way
required*—include:

-   *Principles of Mathematical Analysis* by Walter Rudin

-   *Linear Algebra* by David Lay

-   *Calculus: Concepts and Methods* by Ken Binmore and Joan Davies

-   *Optimization in Economic Theory* by Avinash K. Dixit

-   *A First Course in Optimization Theory* by Rangarajan Sundaram

Please refer any administrative questions to the course administrator
Karissa Carkeet, room 1013, HW Arndt Bulding (25a).

All students are welcome to discuss course material with the tutors or
myself during tutorials and respective office hours. However, please do
not use email for instructional purposes.
